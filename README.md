# Dungeon

Dungeon is a C# game developed as part of the *Computer Lab 3* course. Inspired by [Rogue Fable III](https://justin-wang123.itch.io/rogue-fable-iii), this game challenges players to explore procedurally generated dungeons, defeat enemies, gather treasure, and progress through increasingly difficult levels.

## Game Objective
- Collect as many coins and points as possible.
- Advance to higher levels by lighting all torches in each room.

## Gameplay

- **Attacking Enemies / Opening Chests**: Left-click on the enemy or chest.
- **Lighting Torches**: Approach the torch stand and left-click to light it.
- **Buying Upgrades**: Purchase upgrades from the main menu using coins collected during gameplay.

## Features
- **Random Dungeon Generation**: Each level is generated using the [Basic BSP Dungeon Generation algorithm](https://www.roguebasin.com/index.php/Basic_BSP_Dungeon_generation), ensuring a unique experience every time.
- **Upgrades and Equipment**: Players can buy health, speed, and damage boosts from the shop menu. Available equipment includes various swords and armor pieces.
